                <h2>Aerial Hammock</h2>
                <p>With the hammocks low to the ground this is an excellent form of exercise for the complete beginner.</p>
                <p>Being in the air takes away some of the pressure that normal stretching or floor yoga based moves can cause.</p>
                <p>The hammock can aid in movement, strength and flexibility and allows people of all ages and abilities to feel like they have done an all over body workout.</p>

                <h2>Pole Dancing</h2>
                <p>Pole Dancing is becoming vastly more popular around the world as a form of exercise, as a hobby and as a great confidence booster. We have a variety of Pole classes ranging from Pole Fitness to Stripper Pole.</p>

                <h2>Aerial Hoop</h2>
                <p>Aerial Hoop is generally taught using a large metal hoop suspended in the air, moves are created holding, sitting and hanging on the equipment in creative dynamic sequences.</p>
                <p>Aerial Hoop often called a Lyra truly is a full body workout and is great for your core, coordination and flexibility.</p>
                <p>varying styles of Aerial Hoop make it accessible to everyone and promises to be a great confidence booster.</p>
                <p>Easily one of the more prettier Aerial Arts, there will be lots of chances for you to snap a photo or two.</p>

                <h2>Aerial Silks</h2>
                <p>Silks uses long pieces of fabric suspended from the ceiling, in this class we teach you how to climb, invert and build strength, many moves are centred around the fabric and mostly in the air.</p>
                <p>Silks will help develop confidence, build upper body strength, flexibility all while toning and increasing core strength.</p>

                <h2>Lollipop Lyra</h2>
                <p>Lollipop Lyra is a fusion of Hoop and Pole, itâ€™s a relatively new piece of aerial equipment and has great versatility.</p>
                <p>On this interesting aerial apparatus you can spin, create shapes and flow beautifully.</p>
                <p>Lollipop Lyra is a fun way to get fit, build both upper body, core strength and flexibility.</p>
